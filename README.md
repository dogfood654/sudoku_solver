# sudoku_solver

This is after I kinda 'mastered' the recursion logic when learning to build the minimax algorithm for tictactoe.

The algorithm is referenced from a Youtube video - Computerphile - Python Sudoku Solver. It is using the backtracking model, i.e. testing all possible moves and backtracks whenever it meets a deadend.
